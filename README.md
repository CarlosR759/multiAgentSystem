Full stack web app to interact with large language models, currently in progress.

This is how to install it:

### First create Python virt env:
```bash
python -m venv <multiAgentSystem>
```
Or you can just use this if you don't want to create a new folder:
```bash
python -m venv .
```
### Go to your virt env in your "multiAgentSytem" folder:
```bash
source bin/activate
```
### Then use the requirements.txt to download from pip the packages needed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Then Run the python script
```bash
python chat_app.py
```
After that you can access the application going to your browser with:
```bash
localhost:8000
```
